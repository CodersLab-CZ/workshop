LOTTO is a numeric game that involves drawing 6 numbers from the range of 1 â€“ 49. The player's task is to correctly
guess the drawn numbers. You are rewarded if you correctly match 3, 4, 5 or 6 numbers.

Write a program that:

1. asks user to select 6 numbers, while checking the following conditions:
    - whether the string entered is a valid number,
    - whether the user has not entered a given number before,
    - if the number is in the range of 1-49,
2. after entering 6 numbers, sorts them in ascending order and displays them on the screen,
3. draws 6 numbers from the range and displays them on the screen,
4. informs the player how many numbers they have matched.
